# fastai3

Research repo for code that may or may not end up in fastai3. (NB: there may not even *be* a fastai3 -- part of the purpose of this repo is to decide if we want to go down that path...)

There's a research project [here](https://github.com/fastai/fastai3/projects/1) and also a features project in fastai/fastai repo [here](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/projects/1).
